Files & Paths Expansion — Design Intent Archive
----------------------------------------------

Scope
- Extend directory listing with type filtering; add vector glob filter utility.

Decisions & Rationale
- read_dir(path, filter="filesdirs"):
  - filter: "filesdirs" (default), "fileonly", "dironly".
  - Lists directory contents only - NO globbing.
  - NO glob wildcards in path argument (prevents security/ambiguity issues).
  - Keeps read_dir focused on ONE task: reading a directory.
  
- glob_search(vector, pattern):
  - Filters any vector by glob pattern (maximally reusable).
  - Not file-specific - works on any vector of strings.
  - Encourages composition: scad_files = glob_search(read_dir("src", filter="fileonly"), "*.scad").
  
- Why no glob_pattern parameter on read_dir?
  - Separation of concerns: read_dir lists, glob_search filters.
  - Avoids duplicating glob_search functionality.
  - Prevents path glob ambiguity (is "test*" a dirname or pattern?).
  - Composition is clear and idiomatic (Unix philosophy: ls | grep).
  
- Security/visibility:
  - Continue to exclude hidden/system/dotfiles/symlinks (current behavior).
  - Path resolution remains relative to the .scad file location.
  - No glob wildcards allowed in path argument.
  
- Cross-platform: same normalization/canonical rules as current file funcs; UTF-8 paths.

Open Questions (deferred)
- No write operations (write_text, etc.) in this batch; consider later with opt-in safeguards.
- No metadata (timestamps, symlink info) in this batch.

Testing Plan
- Keep tests in tests/data/scad/functions-files/.
- Test glob_search with various patterns.
- Test read_dir with filter parameter.
- Test composition: glob_search(read_dir(...), pattern).
