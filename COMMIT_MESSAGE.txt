This commit integrates the wwWidgets library (QwwColorComboBox color selection widgets)
into OpenSCAD's build system using a pre-built artifact deployment strategy.

CHANGES:

CMakeLists.txt (3 changes):
  • Line 427: Added add_subdirectory(src/ext/wwwidgets) to import IMPORTED library
  • Line 1617: Added wwwidgets to Qt6 target_link_libraries

  • src/ext/wwwidgets/include/ - Pre-built headers (awaiting deployment)
  • src/ext/wwwidgets/lib/ - Pre-built library (awaiting deployment)

DEPLOYMENT:
-----------

Once wwWidgets is built with deploy-openscad target:

1. Copy headers: deploy-openscad/include/* → src/ext/wwwidgets/include/
2. Copy library: deploy-openscad/lib/libwwwidgets.a → src/ext/wwwidgets/lib/
3. Update VERSION.txt with build metadata
4. Configure & build: cmake .. -DUSE_QT6=ON && cmake --build .
